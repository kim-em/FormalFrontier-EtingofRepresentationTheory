# Theorem 5.26.1: Artin's Theorem

Let X be a conjugation-invariant system of subgroups of a finite group G.
Two conditions are equivalent:

(i) Any element of G belongs to a subgroup H ∈ X.

(ii) The character of any irreducible representation of G belongs to the
ℚ-span of characters of induced representations Ind_H^G V, where H ∈ X
and V is an irreducible representation of H.

## Mathlib correspondence

Uses `Subgroup`, `FDRep.character`, `CategoryTheory.Simple` for irreducible
representations, and `Submodule.span ℚ` for rational linear combinations.
The induced character is expressed via the Frobenius character formula.

/-- Frobenius reciprocity for character inner products: for a class function f on G
and a function χ on a subgroup H,
  ∑_{g:G} f(g) · (Ind_H^G χ)(g⁻¹) = (|G|/|H|) · ∑_{h:H} f(↑h) · χ(h⁻¹)
This is a direct computation from the Frobenius character formula:
1. Expand Ind_H^G(χ)(g⁻¹) using the Frobenius formula
2. Swap the double sum over G × G to G × G
3. For each x, substitute h = x⁻¹g⁻¹x (bijection G → G restricting to H)
4. Use that f is a class function: f(xh⁻¹x⁻¹) = f(h⁻¹)
5. Factor out |G| from the sum over x. -/

/-- Character completeness on subgroups: if a class function f on G, when restricted to
a subgroup H, is orthogonal to all irreducible characters of H, then f vanishes on H.

This follows from Theorem 4.2.1 applied to H: the restriction f|_H is a class function
on H (since f is a class function on G and H is a subgroup), and characters of irreducible
representations of H span all class functions on H. The orthogonality condition forces
all Fourier coefficients to be zero, so f|_H = 0.

Requires `[IsAlgClosed ℂ]` and `[Invertible (Fintype.card ↥H : ℂ)]` (both automatic
over ℂ since it is algebraically closed with characteristic 0). -/

/-- Integer rank preservation for Artin's theorem (Remark 5.26.2):
When X covers G, every irreducible character of G lies in the ℚ-span
of induced characters from X.

This combines:
(a) The orthogonal complement argument: by `frobenius_char_reciprocity` +
    `class_fun_vanishes_on_subgroup_of_orthogonal` + `covering_implies_vanishing`,
    any class function orthogonal to all induced characters from X vanishes identically.
    This shows the ℂ-span of induced characters = space of all class functions.
(b) The integer rank argument (Remark 5.26.2): each induced character decomposes
    as Ind_H^G(W) = ∑_V n_V · χ_V with n_V ∈ ℕ (multiplicities of irreducibles
    in the induced representation). The decomposition matrix M has ℕ entries
    and full rank over ℂ (from step (a)), hence full rank over ℚ (Cramer's rule:
    det ∈ ℤ, cofactors ∈ ℤ). So each χ_V is a ℚ-linear combination of the
    induced characters. -/

/-- Forward direction of Artin's theorem: if X covers G, every irreducible character
is in the ℚ-span of induced characters from X.

Proof outline (Etingof, Theorem 5.26.1):
1. By `frobenius_char_reciprocity`: if f is orthogonal to all Ind_H^G(W), then
   f|_H is orthogonal to all irreducible characters of H (up to a nonzero scalar).
2. By `class_fun_vanishes_on_subgroup_of_orthogonal`: f vanishes on H.
3. By `covering_implies_vanishing`: since X covers G, f vanishes on all of G.
4. Steps 1-3 show the orthogonal complement of induced characters is trivial.
5. By `artin_Q_span_of_induced_chars` (Remark 5.26.2): the ℚ-span of induced
   characters contains all irreducible characters.

Sorry status: 2 sorry'd helpers (`class_fun_vanishes_on_subgroup_of_orthogonal`,
`artin_Q_span_of_induced_chars`). `frobenius_char_reciprocity` and
`covering_implies_vanishing` are fully proved.
The `artin_forward` proof itself is sorry-free given the helpers. -/

Condition (i) states that X covers G: every element belongs to some H ∈ X.
